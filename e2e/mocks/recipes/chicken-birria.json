  "description": "Birria is a typical dish of Guadalajara, Mexico (the city where Margarita was born). The original recipe calls for lamb or beef for the meat, however, this variation is Margarita’s mom's recipe and has chicken instead. It is very tasty, easy to cook, and best of all, healthy in many ways.\n\nAccompany this dish with warm tortillas when eating and enjoy!",
