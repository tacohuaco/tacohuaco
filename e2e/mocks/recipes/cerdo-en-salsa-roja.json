  "description": "This is one of Artem’s favorite Mexican recipes and it can be very very very spicy — if you add a lot of chiles. It takes a bit of time to cook but doesn’t take a lot of attention, and you could cook a lot of it at once and then eat it for several days.\n\nIt makes an amazing lunch with beans ([refried](/recipes/frijoles-refritos/) or just boiled) and warmed-up tortillas.",
